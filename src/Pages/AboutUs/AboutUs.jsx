        Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although
        there are days we wish there was a manual to follow, it simply wouldn't
        be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may not become
        easier as we grow older, but we do seem to understand it better as our
        perspectives evolve. Whether you're embarking on a new adventure right
        out of school or you want to explore different paths in your personal
        life, it's never too late to change what the future looks like.

      Starting with your speech, eliminate negative phrases such as “I can’t”, “I always give up”, or “I am *insert negative adjective*”. For example, you may have found yourself saying, “I am lazy.” A better way to frame this in your mind is “Today I did not accomplish as much as I wanted to. I will make a list for tomorrow so I can complete all of my tasks!”  Additionally, try to avoid complaining at all costs. If you are working with a particularly difficult client, try to view the experience as a positive challenge rather than a negative situation.
